# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. It implements multiple classification algorithms and provides detailed visualizations of the data and model performance.


## Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project aims to predict which passengers survived the tragedy using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Missing value imputation
- Feature engineering
- Multiple classification models
- Detailed visualizations
- Model performance evaluation

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- missingno

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required packages

## Usage

1. Ensure your Titanic dataset is in a CSV file named 'titanic.csv' in the project directory.
2. Run the script
3. The script will output various visualizations and model performance metrics.

## Models

The project implements and compares the following models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

## Visualizations

The script generates various visualizations, including:
- Distribution of categorical features
- Survival rates by different features
- Pairplot of feature relationships
- ROC curves
- Precision-Recall curve
- Confusion matrix heatmap

## Results

The script outputs performance metrics for each model, including:
- Accuracy
- Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Confusion matrix
- ROC AUC score
